# Version Comparison Analysis

## Environment Comparison

### Development Machine (this machine)
- **Package Version**: nginx-proxy-manager-mcp@1.1.2
- **Location**: /Users/adam.gell/Documents/GitHub/nginx-proxy-manager-mcp
- **Status**: Local development version

### Testing Machine (docker02.gell.one)
- **Package Version**: nginx-proxy-manager-mcp@1.1.1
- **Location**: /home/adam/docker-env-20250613-185351
- **Status**: npm installed version

## Key Findings

### 1. Different Package Versions
- **Dev Machine**: v1.1.2 (latest with bug fixes)
- **Test Machine**: v1.1.1 (previous version)

### 2. Same Dependency Versions
Both machines have identical versions of key dependencies:
- **axios**: 1.10.0 (same on both)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk**: 0.5.0 (same on both)
- **zod**: 3.25.64 (same on both)
- **commander**: 14.0.0 (same on both)
- **zod-to-json-schema**: 3.24.5 (same on both)

## Critical Discovery

**The regression is NOT caused by dependency version differences!**

Both machines are running axios 1.10.0, which means:
1. The npm update affected both environments equally
2. The v1.1.2 bug fixes haven't been deployed to the testing machine yet
3. The regression is likely in the NPM server itself, not the MCP client

## Root Cause Analysis Update

Since both environments have the same dependencies but different behavior:
1. **NPM Server Issue**: The Nginx Proxy Manager server (v2.11.3) may have internal issues
2. **Environmental Differences**: Docker environment vs local may behave differently
3. **Server State**: The NPM server may be in a degraded state after the updates

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Deploy v1.1.2 to Testing Machine
```bash
npm update nginx-proxy-manager-mcp@1.1.2
```

### 2. Test Both Axios Versions
Even though both machines show 1.10.0, we should test with the original version:
```bash
npm install axios@1.6.0 --save-exact
```

### 3. Check NPM Server Health
- Restart the NPM Docker container
- Check NPM server logs for errors
- Verify database connectivity

## Testing Strategy

1. **First**: Update testing machine to v1.1.2 and retest
2. **If still failing**: Downgrade axios to 1.6.0 on both machines
3. **If still failing**: Issue is server-side, not client-side

## Conclusion

The version comparison reveals that:
- Both environments have the same dependency versions
- The testing machine is running the older MCP version (1.1.1)
- The regression appears to be environmental or server-side, not purely version-related

The next step is to update the testing machine to v1.1.2 and see if the bug fixes help with the regression.
