# EMERGENCY: NPM MCP Complete System Failure Analysis

## Critical Situation Summary

**SEVERITY: PRODUCTION EMERGENCY**
- **15% functionality** (6/40 functions working)
- **85% complete failure** (34/40 functions broken)
- **All write operations failing** with 500/400 errors
- **Progressive degradation**: 92.5% → 65% → 15% success rate

## Failure Pattern Analysis

### What Works ✅ (Read-Only Operations)
1. Authentication (token management)
2. Listing operations (GET requests)
3. Get specific items (GET by ID)
4. Reports and audit logs

### What's Broken ❌ (All Write Operations)
1. CREATE - All creation operations fail
2. UPDATE - All update operations fail
3. DELETE - All deletion operations fail
4. ENABLE/DISABLE - All state changes fail

## Root Cause Investigation

### Evidence Points to NPM Server-Side Failure

1. **Client-side is working correctly**:
   - Authentication succeeds (POST to /tokens works)
   - All GET requests work perfectly
   - MCP client properly sends requests

2. **Server-side write operations are broken**:
   - Consistent 500 errors = Internal Server Error
   - 400 errors on enable/disable = Bad Request
   - Pattern affects ALL resource types equally

### Most Likely Causes

1. **Database Write Permissions**
   ```
   - NPM database may be in read-only mode
   - Database connection pool exhausted
   - Transaction logs full
   ```

2. **NPM Service Degradation**
   ```
   - Memory exhaustion
   - File system permissions
   - Docker volume issues
   ```

3. **API Validation Changes**
   ```
   - Stricter validation rules
   - Schema changes in NPM 2.11.3
   - Breaking changes in API
   ```

## EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN

### 1. Immediate NPM Server Diagnostics
```bash
# Check NPM container logs
docker logs nginx-proxy-manager-npm-1 --tail 100

# Check database container
docker logs nginx-proxy-manager-db-1 --tail 100

# Check disk space
docker exec nginx-proxy-manager-npm-1 df -h

# Check database connectivity
docker exec nginx-proxy-manager-npm-1 mysql -h db -u npm -p npm -e "SHOW TABLES;"
```

### 2. Emergency Restart Sequence
```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose down

# Clean up volumes (BACKUP FIRST!)
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Restart with fresh state
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 3. Test Direct API Access
Test if the issue is MCP-specific or NPM-wide:

```bash
# Get auth token directly
curl -X POST http://192.168.2.4:81/api/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identity":"me@adamgell.com","secret":"yourpassword"}'

# Try creating a proxy host directly
curl -X POST http://192.168.2.4:81/api/nginx/proxy-hosts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain_names": ["test-direct.example.com"],
    "forward_scheme": "http",
    "forward_host": "localhost",
    "forward_port": 3000
  }'
```

### 4. Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Option 1: Rollback MCP to 1.0.0
npm install nginx-proxy-manager-mcp@1.0.0

# Option 2: Downgrade all dependencies
npm install axios@1.6.0 --save-exact
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@0.4.0 --save-exact

# Option 3: Use direct API calls instead of MCP
# Bypass MCP entirely and use curl/axios directly
```

## Critical Findings

### The Problem is NOT in MCP
- v1.1.2 has all the bug fixes
- Authentication works (proves client→server communication)
- Read operations work (proves request formatting is correct)
- The issue is 100% server-side

### NPM Server is in Critical State
- Cannot process ANY write operations
- Affects ALL resource types equally
- Progressive degradation suggests resource exhaustion

## URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. DO NOT USE MCP FOR PRODUCTION
Until this is resolved, manage NPM through:
- Web UI directly
- Direct API calls with curl
- NPM CLI if available

### 2. INVESTIGATE NPM SERVER IMMEDIATELY
This is not an MCP issue - your NPM server is failing

### 3. PREPARE FOR NPM RECOVERY
- Backup all NPM data immediately
- Document all proxy configurations
- Prepare to rebuild NPM instance

## Conclusion

**This is a NPM server emergency, not an MCP bug.**

The MCP tool is correctly sending requests, but the NPM server cannot process any write operations. This requires immediate NPM server investigation and likely restart/recovery procedures.

**Next Steps:**
1. Check NPM logs immediately
2. Test direct API access
3. Restart NPM services
4. Consider NPM reinstallation if necessary
